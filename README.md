# Top-Monthly-Registrations-Finder
The "Month with Most Registrations" script iterates through a predefined list of monthly sheets within a Google Spreadsheet to determine which sheet has the highest number of registrations. It initializes variables to track the maximum number of registrations and the corresponding sheet name. For each sheet, it calculates the total registrations by counting non-empty cells in a specific column range. If a sheet surpasses the current maximum registrations, it updates the tracking variables. Finally, it outputs the name of the sheet with the highest registrations to a designated cell ("Q6") on a sheet named "Welcome." This script provides a quick way to identify the month with the most recorded registrations across multiple sheets in a spreadsheet setup.
